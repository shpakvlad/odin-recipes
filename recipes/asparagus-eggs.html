    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Asparagus and eggs make the best spring breakfast or a beautiful light lunch. Asparagus is cooked in a pan with a
        little oil, and topped with two eggs.</p>

    <h3>Ingridients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>
            1 tablespoon olive oil
        </li>
        <li>
            1 garlic clove, finely chopped
        </li>
        <li>
            8 thin-stemmed asparagus stalks, trimmed
        </li>
        <li>
            2 large eggs
        </li>
        <li>
            salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
        </li>
        <li>
            1 pinch red pepper flakes (optional)
        </li>
    </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Heat a small skillet over medium-high heat. Add olive oil and garlic; cook and stir until garlic is
                fragrant, about 30 seconds.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add asparagus and cook until fork-tender, turning asparagus often to ensure even cooking, about 4
                minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Spread asparagus out and crack 2 eggs over the asparagus. Cover with lid and cook until egg whites are
                firm and yolk is done to desired consistency, about 4 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Season with salt and pepper; sprinkle with red pepper flakes and serve immediately.
            </li>
        </ol>
